 /// A wrapper for a UIKit view that you use to integrate that view into your
 /// SwiftUI view hierarchy.
 
 /// Use a ``UIViewRepresentable`` instance to create and manage a object in your SwiftUI
 /// interface. Adopt this protocol in one of your app's custom instances, and
 /// use its methods to create, update, and tear down your view. The creation and
 /// update processes parallel the behavior of SwiftUI views, and you use them to
 /// configure your view with your app's current state information. Use the
 /// teardown process to remove your view cleanly from your SwiftUI. For example,
 /// you might use the teardown process to notify other objects that the view is
 /// disappearing.
 
 
 /// To add your view into your SwiftUI interface, create your
 /// ``UIViewRepresentable`` instance and add it to your SwiftUI interface. The
 /// system calls the methods of your representable instance at appropriate times
 /// to create and update the view. The following example shows the inclusion of
 /// a custom `MyRepresentedCustomView` structure in the view hierarchy.
 ///
 ///     struct ContentView: View {
 ///        var body: some View {
 ///           VStack {
 ///              Text("Global Sales")
 ///              MyRepresentedCustomView()
 ///           }
 ///        }
 ///     }
 
 /// The system doesn't automatically communicate changes occurring within your
 /// view to other parts of your SwiftUI interface.  When you want your view to
 /// coordinate with other SwiftUI views, you must provide a
 /// ``NSViewControllerRepresentable/Coordinator`` instance to facilitate those
 /// interactions. For example, you use a coordinator to forward target-action
 /// and delegate messages from your view to any SwiftUI views.
