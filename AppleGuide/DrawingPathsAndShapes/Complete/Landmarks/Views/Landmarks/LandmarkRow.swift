import SwiftUI

/*
 /// A type that collects multiple instances of a content type --- like views,
 /// scenes, or commands --- into a single unit.
 
 /// Use a group to collect multiple views into a single instance, without
 /// affecting the layout of those views, like an ``SwiftUI/HStack``,
 /// ``SwiftUI/VStack``, or ``SwiftUI/Section`` would. After creating a group,
 /// any modifier you apply to the group affects all of that group's members.
 /// For example, the following code applies the ``SwiftUI/Font/headline``
 /// font to three views in a group.
 ///
 ///     Group {
 ///         Text("SwiftUI")
 ///         Text("Combine")
 ///         Text("Swift System")
 ///     }
 ///     .font(.headline)
 ///
 /// Because you create a group of views with a ``SwiftUI/ViewBuilder``, you can
 /// use the group's initializer to produce different kinds of views from a
 /// conditional, and then optionally apply modifiers to them. The following
 /// example uses a `Group` to add a navigation bar title,
 /// regardless of the type of view the conditional produces:
 ///
 ///     Group {
 ///         if isLoggedIn {
 ///             WelcomeView()
 ///         } else {
 ///             LoginView()
 ///         }
 ///     }
 ///     .navigationBarTitle("Start")
 
 /// The modifier applies to all members of the group --- and not to the group
 /// itself. For example, if you apply ``View/onAppear(perform:)`` to the above
 /// group, it applies to all of the views produced by the `if isLoggedIn`
 /// conditional, and it executes every time `isLoggedIn` changes.
 ///
 /// Because a group of views itself is a view, you can compose a group within
 /// other view builders, including nesting within other groups. This allows you
 /// to add large numbers of views to different view builder containers. The
 /// following example uses a `Group` to collect 10 ``SwiftUI/Text`` instances,
 /// meaning that the vertical stack's view builder returns only two views ---
 /// the group, plus an additional ``SwiftUI/Text``:
 ///
 ///     var body: some View {
 ///         VStack {
 ///             Group {
 ///                 Text("1")
 ///                 Text("2")
 ///                 Text("3")
 ///                 Text("4")
 ///                 Text("5")
 ///                 Text("6")
 ///                 Text("7")
 ///                 Text("8")
 ///                 Text("9")
 ///                 Text("10")
 ///             }
 ///             Text("11")
 ///         }
 ///     }
 ///
 /// You can initialize groups with several types other than ``SwiftUI/View``,
 /// such as ``SwiftUI/Scene`` and ``SwiftUI/ToolbarContent``. The closure you
 /// provide to the group initializer uses the corresponding builder type
 /// (``SwiftUI/SceneBuilder``, ``SwiftUI/ToolbarContentBuilder``, and so on),
 /// and the capabilities of these builders vary between types. For example,
 /// you can use groups to return large numbers of scenes or toolbar content
 /// instances, but not to return different scenes or toolbar content based
 /// on conditionals.
